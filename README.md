Personal website for network testing and learning

Deployed to a Debian 11 with docker. 
In front of the nginx web server, there is a nginx reverse proxy that handles ssl.
Ssl is handled by origin server. Created and renewing with certbot by manual.

I use this image to test networks between client and servers.
